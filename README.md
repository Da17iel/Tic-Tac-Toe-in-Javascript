# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-Javascript
For this Project, I attempted to create a Tic Tac Toe game within JavaScript.

## Ultimate Goal
The Goal of this project is not creating an unbeatable AI in Tic Tac Toe neither is it creating the most Popular Tic Tac Toe game in History. The Goal is possible learning more about AI and how it might be used in a practical case. 
This should help me understand AI a little more and possibly do more of this in the future. 


## Minimax Algorithm
Programming the functionality of Tic Tac Toe is pretty simple. The hard Part is programming an opponent. I plan on doing that using the [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). This algorithm is prefect for a game like chess or Tic Tac Toe.
Here is a [pretty good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk9hlNZc6sE) which explains the concept.

## Documentation
All of the finished code should be commented. For a project this simple this should be documentation enough.
